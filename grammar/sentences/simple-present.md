The simple present expresses an action in the present taking place regularly, never or several times. It is also used for actions that take place one after another and for actions that are set by a timetable or schedule. The simple present also expresses facts in the present.

## Form

**be**

Use:

am with the personal pronoun II
is with the personal pronouns he, she or it (or with the singular form of nouns)
are with the personal pronouns we, you or they (or with the plural form of nouns)
example: I am hungry.

```
            affirmative	negative	question
I	        I am.	    I am not.	Am I?
he/she/it	He is.	    He is not.	Is he?
you/we/they	You are./You are not.	Are you?
```

----

have
Use:

have with the personal pronouns I, you, we und they (or with the plural form of nouns)
has with the personal pronouns he, she, it (or with the singular form of nouns)
example: I have a dog. / I have got a dog.

'have got' is mainly used in British English. You can also use 'have' on its own (especially in American English). In this case, however, you must form negative sentences and questions with the auxiliary verb 'do' (see 'All other verbs').

 	positiv	negativ	question
I/you/we/they	I have got. / I have.	I have not got. / I do not have.	Have I got? / Do I have?
he/she/it	He has got. / He has.	He has not got. / He does not have.	Has he got? / Does he have?

All other verbs
Use:

the infinite verb (play) with the personal pronouns I, you, we and they (or with the plural form of nouns)
the verb + s (plays) with the personal pronouns he, she, it (or with the singular form of nouns)

```
                affirmative	negative	    question
I/you/we/they	I play.	    I do not play.	    Do I play?
he/she/it	    He plays.	He does not play.	Does he play?
```
Tips on how to form negative sentences and questions
Negative sentences and questions are formed with the auxiliary verb 'do'.


The 3rd person singular of 'do' is 'does'. This means that in negative sentences and questions the 's' of the main verb is placed behind 'do'.

## **Exception in spelling**

The verbs can, may, might, must remain the same in all forms. So don't add s.
example: he can, she may, it must

Verbs ending in o or a sibilant (ch, sh, s, x) add es instead of s.
example: do - he does, wash - she washes

A final y after a consonant becomes ie before s.
example: worry - he worries

But: A final y after a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) is not modified.

example: play - he plays

## Use

facts (something is generally known to be true)
