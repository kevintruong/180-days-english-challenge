# **Present Progressive**

## Introduction

The present progressive puts emphasis on the course or duration of an action.

![Time line](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-1.en.png)

The present progressive is used for actions going on in the moment of speaking and for actions taking place only for a
short period of time. It is also used to express development and actions that are arranged for the near future.

Present progressive is also known as present continuous.

## Form

Use a form of _to be_ and the infinite verb plus _\-ing_.

### Tips on how to form negative sentences and questions

In negative sentences, we put **not** between the form of _be_ and the verb.

In questions, we simply swop the places of _subject_ and the form of _be_.

## Present Progressive - Exceptions in Spelling

### A single, silent _e_ at the end of the word is dropped before ing.

example: com_e_ - coming  
I am coming home. You are coming home. He is coming home.

**But**: _ee_ at the end of the word is not changed

example: agree - agreeing

### The final consonant after a short, stressed vowel is doubled before ing.

example: s_it_ - si**tt**ing  
I am sitting on the sofa. You are sitting on the sofa. He is sitting on the sofa.

### The letter l as final consonant after a vowel is always doubled before ing.

example: travel - trave**ll**ing  
I am travelling around. You are travelling around. He is travelling around.

Mind: This applies only for British English; in American English there is usually only one **l**.

### An _ie_ at the end of a word becomes _y_ before ing.

example: lie - l**y**ing  
I am lying in bed. You are lying in bed. He is lying in bed.

## Use

Actions taking place at the moment of speaking (now) 


![playing football](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-5.png)  
He is playing football.

The action is going on now.

Signal words like _now_, _at the moment_ are often used to emphasise that the action is taking place at the moment of speaking. Signal words are not really necessary, however, as this is already expressed by the tense itself.

Arrangements for the near future 

![ticket](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-6.png)  
I'm going to the theatre tonight.

In the example you can see that the tickets are already bought. So we are talking about an arrangement for the near future.

To make clear that the action is not going on now, we usually use signal words like _tonight_, _tomorrow_, _next Friday_, _at noon_.

Actions taking place only for a limited period of time 

![my brother's firm](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-7.png)  
Jim is helping in his brother's firm this week.

Here we are talking about a time limit. Jim does not usually work in the firm, he is still at school and wants to earn some extra money during his holidays.

To make clear that there is a time limit, we usually use signal words, e.g. _this week/month/year_.

Actions taking place around now (but not at the moment of speaking) 

![talking](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-8.png)  

I'm studying for my exams.

----

This action takes place around now and only for a limited period of time, but not at the moment of speaking.

We don't have to use signal words here, but we often find signal words in such sentences, e.g. _now_, _at the moment_.

Development, changing situations 

![Chinese](https://www.ego4u.com/images/grammar/present-progressive-9.gif) 
The population of China is rising very fast.

The sentence describes a development from one situation to another.

Signal words are not that common here, only sometimes the change of situation is emphasised by using for example _more and more_.
